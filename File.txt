This is a file
A file is this
Github is fun
We aren't done
RoboJackets
Makes files
With 
	make file
When the files compile
Files compiling makes me smile
And I smile with style
Because I make my files with proper style
Those against me are in denial

Throwing the circuits into a pile
All of the bugs will be exiled
Because I squish them
Compiler errors I dish them

Synthesized some Verilog for an FPGA
Making the files made me say "Yay"
Fools who use VHDL are astray
Programmable logic all the way

Made some low pass filters
Because the high frequency noise causes disruptions
But the binary files are full of corruption
And my digital systems require interruptions
Yeah
	Interruptions
Yeah
	Interruptions come from interrupts
Yeah
	Itty bitty interrupts
Yeah
	Gotta have them interrupts
Yeah
